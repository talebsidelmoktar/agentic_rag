# Agentic RAG Project

This project implements an **Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system that combines the power of Large Language Models (LLMs), dynamic tool use, and multi-step reasoning to answer complex queries using external knowledge sources.

## Overview

**Agentic RAG** enhances traditional RAG pipelines by introducing agents capable of:
- Planning and reasoning through multiple steps
- Interacting with external tools like web search, document retrieval, and APIs
- Synthesizing information from multiple sources
- Maintaining memory across interactions

## Features

- **LLM-powered agents** using [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/), [LangGraph](https://www.langgraph.dev/), or custom logic
- **Retriever integration** (e.g., vector databases like FAISS, Chroma, or Weaviate)
- **Tool calling** for search, calculators, custom APIs, etc.
- **Multi-step workflows** for complex queries
- **Memory and context management** for
